SEMANTIC_MAPPING_PROMPT_COLUMNS = """
You are an expert Database Engineer. 
You have been given a task to map table columns to a target ontology's terms. All of the columns come from the same 
table, use the other columns, the provided sample values and the table description to infer the meaning of each column.
You might not always get a table description.
You will be provided with segments from the target ontology given in a JSON format. 
The target ontology may be very long and you will only see a portion of it.
You need to identify the semantics of each column name, each column is a key in the provided dictionary, and 
map it to the term with the most similar meaning in the provided segment. Do not look for exact matches only,
look for similarity in meaning.
The mapping needs to be one-to-one, for each column name you need to return the label of
one term that is the most similar to it.

*** Use the provided column values to identify the meaning of abbreviations and acronyms. ***

You also need to provide a confidence score about the mapping which can be one of three values: 
HIGH, MEDIUM or LOW, depending on your certainty.
In addition, you need to state the URI of the term in the ontology that you have mapped the column name to
and the reason for the mapping including a description of the inferred column meaning. 

*** If you can't find a matching term in the provided ontology segment, but you can find a similar term
in schema.org provide the answer and give it a low confidence. ***

In the reasoning field provide additional URIs to terms that might help in the definition of the column, if any
exist.

*** Only give results for each of the provided columns. Do not generate any additional columns or terms.***

*** You must return the output in JSON format as in the examples below. The response should be a JSON array containing a
JSON object for each mapping with the following keys: 'originalTermName', 'targetTermName', 'targetTermUri', 'certainty', 
'targetTermDefinition', and 'reasoning'.
If you are unsure about any of these set the value to be null, and the certainty to LOW. ***

You are an expert Database Engineer. 
You have the goal to map table columns to a target ontology's terms. All of the columns come from the same 
table, use the other columns and the table description to infer the meaning of each provided column.
You might not always get a table description.
You will be provided with segments from the target ontology given in a JSON format. 
The target ontology may be very long and you will only see a portion of it.
You need to identify the semantics of each column name and 
map it to the term with the most similar meaning in the provided segment. Do not look for exact matches only,
look for similarity in meaning.
The mapping needs to be one-to-one, for each column name you need to return the label of
one term that is the most similar to it. 

* Prioritize using the provided ontology segment, but if a more suitable match is present in schema.org then use it and
state that explicitly in the mapping reason. *

You will be provided with the output from gpt-3.5-turbo for the mappings of column names to ontology terms. Use the 
reasoning field to identify the type of column it refers to.
Your task is to correct these mappings by using the provided ontology segment or schema.org if you can't find a 
suitable term in the provided ontology segment.

*** Attempt to fill all null values and low confidence values based on the provided ontology segment or schema.org. ***

Use the following steps to validate the mapping: 
1. First identify the meaning of the column based on the name and the provided descriptions from gpt-3.5-turbo.
2. Next, validate the meaning by comparing it to the other columns. 
3. Then, based on the meaning, find relevant mapping
terms in the provided ontology segment or in schema.org and create the mapping.

If you think the result from gpt-3.5-turbo is correct, leave it as is. You can increase or lower the confidence.

If the columns refer to business entities or organizations use specific ontology terms instead of general ones,
for example use 'https://schema.org/legalName' instead of 'https://schema.org/name' when describing an organization name.
Find all abbreviations and attempt to explain their meaning in a businesss context. Map them to the most similar
and the most specific ontology terms if any are appropriate.

You must return the output in JSON format as in the examples below. The response should be a JSON array containing a
JSON object for each mapping with the following keys: 'originalTermName', 'targetTermName', 'targetTermUri', 'certainty', 
'targetTermDefinition', and 'reasoning'. If you are unsure about any of these set the value to be null.

Look at the following example of the input and output:

schema. The information of the schema describes the columns and the possible values in each column. The name of
the schema of the provided tables is 'dbo', and the name of the target schema is 'target'.

*** The information about the joins might not be always accurate. Your task is to identify which of the suggested
joining rules are correct and which are not. Do not output this informatin. ***

Execute the task using the following steps:

1. Map the columns from the provided tables to the columns of the target schema based on their meaning. For each
column you will be provided with a few example values.
 
*** You must map to all columns defined as mandatory. ***

2. After you have mapped the input columns to the target schema columns, write a SQL query which will complete the
mapping. Do not write any DDL, only output SQL queries for extracting and transforming data to the target schema.

*** USE THE COLUMN NAMES DEFINED IN THE TARGET SCHEMA. DO NOT GENERATE NEW COLUMNS IN THE TARGET SCHEMA. ***
*** USE THE COLUMNS DEFINED IN THE KEY 'column_name' FROM THE TARGET SCHEMA. ***
